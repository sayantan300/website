!(https://discord.gg/Rf3xPMm)[https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/602906543356379156/widget.png?style=banner2]
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY THIS GUIDE WOULD BE THERE, IT'S BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SHOW AND HELP OTHERS GET UP THEIR OWN BOTS, WHILE OTHER PEOPLE LEARNING OUR BOT'S CODE, CREATING MORE NEW COMMANDS AND CODES FOR OUR BOT FOR IT'S FASTER DEVELOPEMENT.

## WHAT SPECIAL FEATURES DO WE HAVE ???

WE HAVE CURRENTLY
- MUSIC
- COMPILER FOR ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
- STARBOARD FOR OUR OWN SERVER
- TEXT TO SPEECH
- CHAT BOT
- MEMES
- ANIMES
- AND MUCH MORE COMING!

# WHAT COMMAND HANDLER DO WE USE ?

WE USE **NODE-FETCH COMMAND HANDLER** WHICH WORKS WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EDITING OF CODE. WE DIRECTLY CUT AND PASTE THE _IF-ELSE_ PART OF CODES AND PASTE IT IN NEW FILES AND WE FETCH IT USING **NODE-FETCH** AND **EVAL** IT !

AND IT WORKS **PERFECTLY FINE** !!!
